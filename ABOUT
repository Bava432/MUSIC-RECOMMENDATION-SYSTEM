Mood-Based Music Player 

A Mood-Based Music Player is a smart application that selects and plays music based on the user’s emotional state. This project aims to provide an enhanced user experience by automatically curating playlists that match the user’s mood. It can be a simple yet effective project for a college mini-project, demonstrating the integration of user interaction, data processing, and multimedia handling.

Feature	Description:
Manual Mood Selection	Users select their mood from predefined options.
Mood Detection (Optional)	AI-based detection of mood from facial expressions or text input.
Predefined Playlists	A set of playlists is linked to different moods.
Music Playback Controls	Play, pause, skip, volume control.
User Customization	Users can modify playlists or add songs to mood categories.

Advantages of This Project
	•	Interactive & Fun: Engages users by curating songs based on their emotions.
	•	Real-World Relevance: Similar to personalized music recommendations on Spotify.
	•	Beginner-Friendly: Can be built using simple technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, Python).
	•	Scalability: Can be extended with APIs, AI models, and personalized recommendations.

  1. How Does It Work?

The project follows these steps:
	1.	Mood Input Collection
	•	The user selects their current mood manually (e.g., Happy, Sad, Relaxed, Energetic, Focused).
	•	Alternatively, an AI-powered system can detect mood using facial expressions (via a webcam) or text sentiment analysis (by analyzing user text input).
	2.	Processing the Mood Data
	•	Based on the selected or detected mood, the system categorizes it into predefined mood categories.
	•	Each mood category is linked to a specific playlist or a set of recommended songs.
	3.	Playing Mood-Based Music
	•	The system fetches and plays a playlist that aligns with the detected mood.
	•	Music files can be stored locally or streamed via an API like Spotify or YouTube.
	4.	User Controls
	•	Users can play, pause, skip, and adjust volume like in a standard music player.
	•	They may also change their mood manually to update the song selection.
